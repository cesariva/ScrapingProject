The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.
(CVE-2009-3555)

Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about the CVE-2009-3555 flaw:
http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

Dan Kaminsky found that browsers could accept certificates with MD2 hash signatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically strong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a malicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser. OpenSSL now disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside signatures by default. (CVE-2009-2409)

An input validation flaw was found in the handling of the BMPString and UniversalString ASN1 string types in OpenSSL's ASN1_STRING_print_ex() function. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted X.509 certificate that could cause applications using the affected function to crash when printing certificate contents. (CVE-2009-0590)

Note: The affected function is rarely used. No application shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux calls this function, for example.

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.","[u'http://www.nessus.org/u?8293c0a3', u'http://www.nessus.org/u?88adda1d', u'http://www.nessus.org/u?489ca7c4', u'http://www.nessus.org/u?1ff00b55']",2019/03/14,[u'ssh_get_info.nasl'],CentOS 3 / 4 : openssl (CESA-2010:0163),3,2010/03/26,"This script is Copyright (C) 2010-2019 and is owned by Tenable, Inc. or an Affiliate thereof.",,CVSS2#AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P,current,310,,[u'34256'],Update the affected openssl packages.,The remote CentOS host is missing one or more security updates.,,CentOS Local Security Checks,true,45346,2010:0163,local

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always check the return value of the bn_wexpand() function. An attacker able to trigger a memory allocation failure in that function could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
